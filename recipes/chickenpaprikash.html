      <li>1 large yellow onion, minced</li>

      <li>2 plum tomatoes, cored, seeded, and cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
      <li>
        1 Italian frying pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1 inch pieces

      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt lard or heat oil in a 6-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with salt and pepper. Working in batches, cook, flipping
        once, until browned, 8–10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion to pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 8
        minutes. Add paprika; cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken and its juices to the pan. Add stock, tomatoes, and
        Italian frying pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, partially covered, until chicken is fully cooked, about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving platter; spoon sour cream over
        top and garnish with more paprika.
      </li>
    </ol>
